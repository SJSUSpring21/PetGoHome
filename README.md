Project Ideas

Dinner photo sharing platform - 
During the epidemic, going to restaurant has become a very difficult task. Everyone eats at home every day. We want to build a platform for everyone to share his/her dinner with photos, a simple, relaxing way. At the same time, it can give other people a little inspiration, not cooking the same food every day.

Vaccine Distribution and tracking -
We want to build a website to speed up the registration and distribution of vaccines through local demographic information. We will use some visualization methods and charts to make it easier for the public to understand when and where they can register for vaccinations. We will use the population datasets to get an estimate of the percentages of people from different age groups that will inturn help with distribution of vaccines in an efficient way.


Stray pets map - 
We want to make a map of lost dogs or pets, combined with google map. When someone's dog or pet is lost, they can go to the website and register the lost location and time along with the description of their pets, so that other people or nearby residents can help to find them. We can also coordinate with local pet services and veternary clinics so that they can get immediate treatment incase they are injured.
