Municipalities often have an animal control\n              department. Except for large cities, they usually do not have a\n              shelter, but they may have a temporary holding area. In small\n              communities there may not be a dedicated animal control person. In\n              that case the police may be able to help. Use a search engine,\n              like Google, or dial 411, to get phone numbers for police and\n              animal control in your community.\n            </Paper>\n          </Grid>\n          {/* -------------------------------- right cloumn------------------------------ */}\n          <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>\n            <Paper className={GridClasses.paper}>\n              <h2>\n                <LockIcon></LockIcon>Pounds and Shelters\n              </h2>\n              Most urban municipalities maintain a “pound” or a shelter. Many\n              states, like Ohio, have a shelter for each county. As government\n              agencies, these shelters are “open admission” which means they\n              take in all animals that they pick up or are surrendered. The\n              holding period for animals that have been picked up or surrendered\n              is usually governed by law. It varies from state to state but\n              averages about four days. It is imperative to visit in person any\n              shelters where your pet might turn up as soon and as often as\n              possible. Just contacting shelters or paying a service to contact\n              them is usually ineffective.\n            </Paper>\n          </Grid>\n        </Grid>\n      </div>\n      {/* -----------------------------second row-------------------------------------_ */}\n\n      <div>\n        <Grid container spacing={3}>\n          <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>\n            <Paper className={GridClasses.paper}>\n              <h2>\n                <HomeIcon></HomeIcon>Humane Societies\n              </h2>\n              These are generally private entities and usually non-profit. They\n              depend on public support to pay the bills. Some humane societies\n              have a policy of never euthanizing animals for want of space. They\n              must limit how many animals they can take in. Other humane\n              societies have open admission, which means that they will take in\n              all pets that are surrendered but they may be put down if they are\n              not adopted. Nationwide, less than 20% of cats that enter a\n              shelter ever find a home. According to the Humane Society of the\n              United States, based on a survey of the 3,500 shelters and humane\n              societies in the U.S. about 30% of shelter dogs are reclaimed by\n              owners, but only 2 to 5% of cats. People are quick to report a\n              stray dog, but free-roaming cats go largely unnoticed. They may\n              surface only after many weeks or months and by that time their\n              family may have given up. We encourage you not to abandon your\n              search too soon.

Some specialize in a certain type of animal, like\n              ferrets or birds, or in a certain breed of dog or cat. They often\n              save companion animals from situations of abuse, neglect or\n              abandonment. Some rescue groups “pull” dogs or cats from shelters\n              and foster them until they can be placed. Rescue groups do not\n              usually have a shelter. Instead they foster the animals in their\n              homes. A lost pet may turn up with a rescue group after being\n              found as a stray, or “rescued” from a bad situation, or after\n              spending time in a shelter. Especially if your lost pet is a\n              special breed, it would be a good idea to contact the appropriate\n              rescue group.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              <h2>\n                <LocalHospitalIcon></LocalHospitalIcon>Veterinarians\n              </h2>\n              Just use a search engine like Google and key in “Veterinarians in\n              [your area].\n            </Paper>\n          </Grid>\n        </Grid>\n        {/* ---------------------------------------bottom content-------------------------------------- */}\n\n        <Grid container spacing={3}>\n          <Grid item xs={24} sm={12}>\n            <Paper className={GridClasses.paper}>\n              <h2>How To Identify the Agencies Near You</h2>\n              It is vital to check all the agencies near you where a lost pet\n              might turn up, or where someone who has lost a pet might have left\n              information. If you live in a large urban area, there may be many,\n              but usually there are just a few key agencies.
