Municipalities often have an animal\n                control department. Except for large cities, they usually do not\n                have a shelter, but they may have a temporary holding area. In\n                small communities there may not be a dedicated animal control\n                person. In that case the police may be able to help. Use a\n                search engine, like Google, or dial 411, to get phone numbers\n                for police and animal control in your community.\n              </Paper>\n            </Grid>\n            {/* -------------------------------- right cloumn------------------------------ */}\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>\n              <Paper\n                className={GridClasses.paper}\n                elevation={8}\n                style={{ borderRadius: \"45px\", height: \"250px\" }}\n              >\n                <h2 className=\"appHeadings\">\n                  <LockIcon></LockIcon>Pounds and Shelters\n                </h2>\n                Most urban municipalities maintain a “pound” or a shelter. Many\n                states, like Ohio, have a shelter for each county. As government\n                agencies, these shelters are “open admission” which means they\n                take in all animals that they pick up or are surrendered. The\n                holding period for animals that have been picked up or\n                surrendered is usually governed by law. It varies from state to\n                state but averages about four days. It is imperative to visit in\n                person any shelters where your pet might turn up as soon and as\n                often as possible. Just contacting shelters or paying a service\n                to contact them is usually ineffective.\n              </Paper>\n            </Grid>\n          </Grid>\n        </div>\n        {/* -----------------------------second row-------------------------------------_ */}\n\n        <div>\n          <Grid container spacing={3}>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>\n              <Paper\n                className={GridClasses.paper}\n                elevation={8}\n                style={{ borderRadius: \"45px\" }}\n              >\n                <h2 className=\"appHeadings\">\n                  <HomeIcon></HomeIcon>Humane Societies\n                </h2>\n                These are generally private entities and usually non-profit.\n                They depend on public support to pay the bills. Some humane\n                societies have a policy of never euthanizing animals for want of\n                space. They must limit how many animals they can take in. Other\n                humane societies have open admission, which means that they will\n                take in all pets that are surrendered but they may be put down\n                if they are not adopted. Nationwide, less than 20% of cats that\n                enter a shelter ever find a home. According to the Humane\n                Society of the United States, based on a survey of the 3,500\n                shelters and humane societies in the U.S. about 30% of shelter\n                dogs are reclaimed by owners, but only 2 to 5% of cats. People\n                are quick to report a stray dog, but free-roaming cats go\n                largely unnoticed. They may surface only after many weeks or\n                months and by that time their family may have given up. We\n                encourage you not to abandon your search too soon.

Some specialize in a certain type of animal, like\n                ferrets or birds, or in a certain breed of dog or cat. They\n                often save companion animals from situations of abuse, neglect\n                or abandonment. Some rescue groups “pull” dogs or cats from\n                shelters and foster them until they can be placed. Rescue groups\n                do not usually have a shelter. Instead they foster the animals\n                in their homes. A lost pet may turn up with a rescue group after\n                being found as a stray, or “rescued” from a bad situation, or\n                after spending time in a shelter. Especially if your lost pet is\n                a special breed, it would be a good idea to contact the\n                appropriate rescue group.\n                <br></br>\n                <h2 className=\"appHeadings\">\n                  <LocalHospitalIcon></LocalHospitalIcon>Veterinarians\n                </h2>\n                Just use a search engine like Google and key in “Veterinarians\n                in [your area].\n                <div style={{ marginBottom: \"1%\" }}></div>\n              </Paper>\n            </Grid>\n          </Grid>\n          {/* ---------------------------------------bottom content-------------------------------------- */}\n\n          <Grid container spacing={3}>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={12}>\n              <Paper\n                className={GridClasses.paper}\n                elevation={8}\n                style={{ borderRadius: \"45px\" }}\n              >\n                <h2 className=\"appHeadings\">\n                  How To Identify the Agencies Near You\n                </h2>\n                It is vital to check all the agencies near you where a lost pet\n                might turn up, or where someone who has lost a pet might have\n                left information.

It gives information for 14,000 agencies nationwide.\n                    You just put in your zip code and you get a list with links\n                    in order of their distance from you. Petfinder is also an\n                    adoption site where shelters can post information about the\n                    pets available for adoption. Sometimes a lost pet will turn\n                    up on an adoption list. If you live in a heavily populated\n                    area your search may turn up dozens of animal agencies. Do\n                    not despair! Just ask any one of them for advice on the most\n                    important ones to call, the ones where a recently lost pet\n                    is most likely to turn up. Chances are there are just a few\n                    likely ones. Over time you can contact them all at the rate\n                    of a few each day.
