Also, pet theft seems to be on the\n        rise. The American Kennel Club has been tracking stolen dog reports\n        since 2007 and notes a 31% increase in recent years.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Pet FBI has had reports of pets snatched from fenced yards, parked cars,\n        front porches, anywhere a pet is left unattended. Occasionally we hear\n        about people whose pets have been taken and dumped by a disgruntled\n        neighbor or an angry spouse.\n      </p>\n\n      <Grid container spacing={3}>\n        <Grid item xs={12} sm={12}>\n          <Paper className={GridClasses.paper} elevation={8}>\n            <h2 className=\"appSubHeadings\">Reasons Pets Are Stolen:</h2>\n            <p>Most often, there is a profit motive to pet theft.</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                Someone might steal a purebred dog in the hopes of selling it to\n                an unsuspecting individual. This is known as “flipping”. Small,\n                purebred dogs like Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, Maltese and\n                Chihuahuas are the most common targets.
