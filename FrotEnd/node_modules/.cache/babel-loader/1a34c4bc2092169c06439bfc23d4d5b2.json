more widespread than people think and it is not just\n        confined to “bad” neighborhoods. Also, pet theft seems to be on the\n        rise. The American Kennel Club has been tracking stolen dog reports\n        since 2007 and notes a 31% increase in recent years.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Pet FBI has had reports of pets snatched from fenced yards, parked cars,\n        front porches, anywhere a pet is left unattended. Occasionally we hear\n        about people whose pets have been taken and dumped by a disgruntled\n        neighbor or an angry spouse.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"appSubHeadings\">Reasons Pets Are Stolen:</h2>\n      <p>Most often, there is a profit motive to pet theft.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Someone might steal a purebred dog in the hopes of selling it to an\n          unsuspecting individual. This is known as “flipping”. Small, purebred\n          dogs like Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, Maltese and Chihuahuas are\n          the most common targets. Such breeds can be sold for thousands of\n          dollars.\n        </li>\n        <li>A pet may be stolen for the prospect of a reward.</li>\n        <li>\n          If the pet is not neutered, it may be stolen for sale to a breeder or\n          a puppy mill.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Dog fighting rings snatch breeds that have a reputation as fighters –\n          Pit Bulls, Boston Terriers, German Shepherds, and Boxers. Dog fighting\n          rings also snatch cats.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Sometimes disgruntled neighbors or family members will steal a pet or\n          will dump it off somewhere.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Fortunately – and this is the only good news about stolen pets – a new\n          law effective in 2016 prohibits the sale of “randomly collected”\n          animals to labs. “Class B dealers” are finally out of business.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        If you are reading this it may be that you think your pet has been\n        stolen.
